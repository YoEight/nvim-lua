Personal NeoVim 0.5 configuration
=================================

This is a 100% Lua Neovim 0.5 configuration. The content of this repository is
expected to be located in `$HOME/.config/nvim`

## Requirements
* [packer.nvim] A Neovim package manager.
* [rust-analyzer] is expected to be in `$PATH`
* [ripgrep]

## Personal notes
* If LSP doesn't seem to work, you probably didn't start NeoVim at the root of your project.

[rust-analyzer]: https://rust-analyzer.github.io/manual.html#installation
[ripgrep]: https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep#installation
